Hey there!
I noticed there is no Proxy Maker for FFTCG and i am not willing to pay a fortune or sell my organs to play casual games so i made one by myself.

A Special thanks to ffdecks.com for the help with the API!

How to use?
Its very simple you add your cards to the cardlist.txt like this >> 2 Mime (1-173C)
Its struct like this >> {Quantity Name (Collector Number)}
Then you can use the .exe and a pdf file is generated in the gen directory that you can print and cut out.

NOTE: The Proxy maker will download ONE Image per DIFFERENT CARD so if you have like '12 Mime (1-172C)' there will be downlaoded only one picture but be aware that you will downlaod Pictures that will be deleted after the generation of the PDF is done.
